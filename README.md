# why to do

As far as we know there are more and more LLMs published recent months, some of them provided the public api, 
others publish the code and weights.however, each one has its own visit link and style, it is hard to combine 
them into one UI, for the following cases:

1. compare the two LLMs with the same context and prompt.
2. to get more options.
3. chat each others to make a sence design.
4. prompt optimization.
